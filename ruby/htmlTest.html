      <p>A has_many association indicates a one-to-many connection with another model. You'll often find this association on
        the
        "other side" of a belongs_to association. This association indicates that each instance of the model has zero or
        more
        instances of another model. For example, in an application containing authors and books, the author model could be
        declared like this:</p>
    
      <p>Date:<time>10:00</time> to <time>21:00</time> every weekday.</p>
